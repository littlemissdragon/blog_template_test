```

## Configuration
Here we will discuss how to *customize* the template for your use case.

### Background Image
There are only two keys of the Jekyll `_config.yml` file that you need to consider:
```yml
high_res_image: "/assets/images/YOUR_HIGH_RES_IMAGE"
low_res_image: "/assets/images/YOUR_LOW_RES_IMAGE"
```

These two *keys* represent the *"high resolution"* and *"low resolution"* versions
of your *background image* (respectively).

### Social Links
You can enable the display of your *social media* links by adding the following to the
`_config.yml` file:
```yml
social:
  x-twitter: "https://twitter.com/yourprofile"
  instagram: "https://instagram.com/yourprofile"
  youtube: "https://youtube.com/yourprofile"
```

This will toggle **on** the display of the social media icons in the header.

### Link Preview
In order for the *link preview* feature to work correctly, you must set the
following keys in your `_config.yml` file:
```yml
default_image: "/assets/images/diogenes_preview.q75.webp"
url: "https://yourwebsite.com"
```
The `default_image` key is the **default image** (for the whole *site*).

The `url` key defines the *domain name* and the *protocol* used (i.e. **https**).
It is important that you use both your website domain name *and* the protocol
as shown below:
```yml
url: "https://yourwebsite.com"
```

Optionally, you can set a *custom* **preview image** and **preview excerpt**.
You can set a *custom preview image* in the *Jekyll* syntax in the front of
an article or *Jupyter Notebook*:
```yml
---
title: "My Jekyll Post"
image: "/path/to/custom/preview/image"
---
```
When the **image** key is set in the *Jekyll YAML front matter* then it will
override the `default_image` set in the `_config.yml`.

For the **excerpt** (which is automatically generated by
default). This can be set *manually* in the *Jekyll YAML front matter*
(just like the preview image):
```yml
---
title: "My Jekyll Post"
image: "/path/to/custom/preview/image"
excerpt: "My custom excerpt that previews what the article is about"
---
```
*NOTE*: if the *excerpt* does not render correct automatically, you can always
set it manually in the *Jekyll YAML front matter*.

### Contact URL Configuration
The Jekyll template allows you to configure multiple **contact** links that will
be displayed on the `/pages/contact.html` page. To enable and customize these
links, you will need to modify the `contacts` section of the `_config.yml` file
like so:
```yml
contacts:
  business: "/business-contact/"
  personal: "/personal-contact/"
```

Each key in the `contacts` dictionary represents the name of the contact, and
the corresponding value is the URL (can be *relative URL*) where the contact
form can be reached. If only **one link** is used then that link will be used
as the reference in the *"Contact"* link in the header of the website:
```yml
contacts:
  basic_contact: "/contact/"
```

In other words, no *additional contact* page will be referenced and when users
click the *"Contact"* link in the header of the website, that link will
reference the single URL (relative or absolute) listed in the `_config.yml`
file.

## Make
Here we will document the different `make` commands defined in the `Makefile`.
All *commands* (excluding the `all` command which is simply executed by
running `make`) are executed by the following format: `make [COMMAND]`. To see
the *contents* of a command that will be executed upon invocation of the
command, simply run `make -n [COMMAND]`.
